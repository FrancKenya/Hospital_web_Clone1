## About the Project

The **Hospital Web Clone** project was inspired by my personal experience with healthcare systems. After encountering inefficiencies in managing appointments and patient records during a family health crisis, I realized how technology could significantly improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare services. This project aims to address these challenges by creating a comprehensive web application for managing hospital services.

This project was developed as part of my portfolio for Holberton School. It represents a significant step in my journey as a developer, combining my interest in technology with a meaningful application that can have a real-world impact.
